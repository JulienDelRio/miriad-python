Miriad-Python version 0.6
Released 2011 April 28

We skipped straight to version 0.6 from version 0.1.0; I think the
higher version number is a better indicator of the quality and
maturity of the software.

Many of the major APIs have been overhauled to be simpler and more
correct. This inclues keyword parsing, task launching, and UV
data reading.

Many new MIRIAD tasks have been wrapped in mirexec, and others have
been wrapped more correctly.

A hashing interface for datasets has been implemented to allow
relatively cheap change detection.

A prototype emulator of MIRIAD's gain calibration logic has been
implemented.

Many small bugs have been fixed, particularly regarding reading
binary numerical data from datasets.

Many new convenience functions have been added.
