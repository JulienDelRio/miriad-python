<h1>miriad-python</h1>

<p>This is the homepage of the <tt>miriad-python</tt> package, which
provides a bridge between <a href="http://www.python.org/">the Python
programming language</a> and <a
href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Miriad">the MIRIAD
radio astronomy package</a>. It provides facilities for:</p>

<ul>
<li>reading and writing MIRIAD datasets in Python,</li>
<li>executing MIRIAD tasks from Python, and</li>
<li>implementing MIRIAD tasks in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="docs/">Miriad-Python
Manual</a>, which is a work in progress.</p>

<p>Miriad-Python is almost entirely Free Software, licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL version 3</a> or
later. Small portions of it are licensed under a BSD license with an
advertising clause that limits your ability to make advertising claims

<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>2011 April 28:</b> You wouldn’t know it by looking at this
webpage, but Miriad-Python has been evolving steadily over
the past year and a half. Today I’m releasing <a
href="miriad-python-0.6.tar.gz">version 0.6</a>, which is a <em>vast</em>
improvement over the previous public version. It is much more
correct and also much easier to use for a variety of tasks. Check
it out!</p>

<p><b>2009 September 28:</b> The first public release of
Miriad-Python, <a href="miriad-python-0.1.0.tar.gz">version 0.1.0</a>,
has been posted, and this website has been created. Even though this
is the first release, it should be quite stable and useful. I’ve been
using Miriad-Python for the past year or so and it’s worked very well
and needed no substantial changes to the overall package design. This
is a source-only release.</p>

<h2>Download and Installation</h2>

<p>Miriad-Python is currently released only as source code. The latest
release is <a href="miriad-python-0.6.tar.gz">version
0.6</a>. Miriad-Python requires at <a
href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> with development files (in
particular, the program <tt>f2py</tt>) installed. Miriad-Python
definitely works with NumPy version 1.5, and may work with NumPy as
old as 1.0, but I haven’t tested which versions work and which don’t.</p>

<p>Miriad-Python also requires a recent working installation of
MIRIAD. Because there are several flavors of MIRIAD that are built and
released in different ways, it’s difficult for us to specify what
exactly is needed. Version 4.1.1 or newer of MIRIAD should work, but
somewhat older versions should also be fine. Installations of MIRIAD
built with the “new-style” build system (using
<tt>configure</tt>) are required. The Miriad-Python build
configuration step should give you an error if it encounters an
install of MIRIAD that it can’t handle. We apologize for being unable
to give more specific requirements, but installations of MIRIAD vary
highly and many MIRIAD installs do not derive from standardized
released packages.</p>

<p>Miriad-Python is built using the standard <a
href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> tools <tt>autoconf</tt>,
<tt>automake</tt>, and <tt>libtool</tt>. Linux programmers and system
administrators should be familiar with these tools if you have any
problems. The generic recipe for building the software is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unpack the source code into a working directory.</li>
<li>In that directory, run <tt>./configure --help</tt> to see a list
of package setup options. In particular, note the
<tt>--with-miriad</tt> and <tt>--prefix</tt> options.</li>
<li>Run <tt>./configure</tt> with any options you need.</li>
<li>Run <tt>make install</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more detailed instructions, see the file <tt>INSTALL</tt>
provided with the source code, or consult your local system
administrator, or email Peter Williams at
<tt>pwilliams@astro.berkeley.edu</tt>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Miriad-Python has a work-in-progress <a href="docs/">manual</a>. We
hope that you’ll find that the manual provides a good overview of the
design of Miriad-Python, but there are unfortunately still gaps in its
coverage. If you’re curious about Miriad-Python, we encourage you to
take a look at the manual and see if it fits your needs.</p>

<h2>Development and Contributions</h2>

<p>We aspire for Miriad-Python to have an open and welcoming
development model. Peter Williams
(<tt>pwilliams@astro.berkeley.edu</tt>) has been the primary developer
but he is happy for others to become involved in the project. The
source code to Miriad-Python is stored in a <a
href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> repository that’s accessible for
read-only access via HTTP <a
href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pkwill/repos/miriad-python.git">here</a>.
For read-write access, contact Peter and he’ll figure something
out.</p>

<p>There are currently no mailing lists or bug trackers for
Miriad-Python because the userbase is too small to warrant
them. If that changes, they’ll be set up.</p>
