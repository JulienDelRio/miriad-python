<h1>miriad-python</h1>

<p>This is the homepage of the <span class="ss">miriad-python</span>
package, which provides a bridge between <a
href="http://www.python.org/">the Python programming language</a> and
<a href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Miriad">the MIRIAD
radio astronomy package</a>. It provides facilities for:</p>

<ul>
<li>reading and writing MIRIAD datasets in Python,</li>
<li>executing MIRIAD tasks from Python, and</li>
<li>implementing MIRIAD tasks in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p class="latest"><b>Downloading:</b> You have two choices for source
code download. For the easiest possible installation, use the <a
href="miriad-python-latest.tar.gz">latest official release
archive</a>. For the latest code and development infrastructure, clone
the <a href="http://github.com/pkgw/miriad-python/"><span
class="ss">miriad-python</span> GitHub repository</a>. The main
inconvenience of the latter method is that you must prepare the build
system using the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system">GNU
“autotools”</a>, which can be quite fragile.</p>

<p class="latest"><b>Installation Instructions:</b> Detailed
instructions are included with the source code. The latest
instructions (including a list of prerequisites) may be <a
href="https://github.com/pkgw/miriad-python/#readme">viewed
on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p class="latest"><b>Documentation:</b> Check out the <a
href="docs/">Miriad-Python Manual</a>, which is a work in
progress. Documentation is included in the source code and built if
you have the necessary tools.</p>

<p class="latest"><b>Bug Reports &amp; Other Contributions:</b> We
aspire for <span class="ss">miriad-python</span> to have an open and
welcoming development model. Report issues to the <a
href="https://github.com/pkgw/miriad-python/issues">GitHub issue
tracker</a>. Email patches <a href="#contact">to the author</a>, or <a
href="http://github.com/pkgw/miriad-python/">fork us on GitHub</a> and
hack away!</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>2013 July 28:</b> <a href="miriad-python-1.2.4.tar.gz">Version
1.2.4</a> is out. It adds experimental support for building against
a CARMA binary distribution of MIRIAD, which is often how Mac users
install MIRIAD on their computers. I’m unable to test this support
extensively, so feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><b>2012 October 15:</b> <a href="miriad-python-1.2.3.tar.gz">Version
1.2.3</a> is out. There are a few build system improvements, but the
main fix is including the README file in the tarballs! Sorry, folks.</p>

<p><b>2012 June 28:</b> <a href="miriad-python-1.2.2.tar.gz">Version
1.2.2</a> is out. The main difference is that the released tarball
contains the full reference to the official <span
class="ss">miriad-python</span> paper in the README. There are also
various changes related to more robust image and WCS loading.</p>

<p><b>2012 March 27:</b> <a href="miriad-python-1.2.1.tar.gz">Version
1.2.1</a> is out, with some important documentation
improvements. Notably, we've started using <a
href="https://github.com/pkgw/miriad-python/issues">the GitHub issue
tracker</a> to keep track of bug reports and feature requests. The
tips for installing MIRIAD itself have also been clarified.</p>

<p><b>2012 March 04:</b> The <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0330"><span
class="ss">miriad-python</span> paper</a> is out on <a
href="http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/recent">astro-ph</a>, and <a
href="miriad-python-1.2.tar.gz">version 1.2</a> is out here! The paper
doesn't talk about the details of <span
class="ss">miriad-python</span> so much, but goes into the context in
which it was written and the larger ecosystem in which it
operates. The new release contains a steady drumbeat of new features,
API improvements, bugfixes, and documentation improvements. Enjoy!</p>

releases are rare. But they're easy to make, so feel free to request
one.</p>
