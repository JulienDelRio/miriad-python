Miriad-Python 0.1.0
===================

Miriad-Python is a bridge between the MIRIAD radio analysis package and
the Python programming language. It allows you to:

* read and write MIRIAD datasets in Python,
* execute MIRIAD tasks from Python, and
* write MIRIAD tasks in Python.

For more information, see
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pkwill/miriad-python/ .  For helpful but
generic installation instructions, see the file INSTALL. For a few
more hints, see the website. For documentation, see the doc/
subdirectory; documentation files are processed using the program
Sphinx. If it's not available on your system, an up-to-date online
copy of the Miriad-Python documentation can be found on the
website. For changes from the previous release, see the file NEWS.

Miriad-Python is primarily written by Peter Williams,
pwilliams@astro.berkeley.edu . This is an early public release with
documentation that's somewhat preliminary, so feel free to get in touch
with him if you have any questions, particularly if you have trouble
installing or using Miriad-Python.


bugrecover_c
============

(This section documents an error that may be reported by the 'configure'
script in certain conditions.)

First of all, sorry for the terse error message produced by the
'configure' program -- the tools we use make it really hard to produce
helpful, descriptive output at that point.

The source of this error is that your installation of Miriad is not
recent enough to contain certain hooks that are necessary for reliable
operation of miriad-python. Installations of Miriad with source code
more recent than February 13, 2009 should work. (Version numbers
aren't very helpful in this case because Miriad release are almost
never made.) The particular error is a lack of the bugrecover_c 
function, which should be found in the libmir_uvio library. Consult
your local Miriad-installation guru for more help if you're not sure
how to react to this situation.
