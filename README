This is a package letting you write Miriad tasks in Python. Oh yes.

bugrecover_c
============

First of all, sorry for the terse error message produced by the
'configure' program -- the tools we use make it really hard to produce
helpful, descriptive output at that point.

The source of this error is that your installation of Miriad is not
recent enough to contain certain hooks that are necessary for reliable
operation of miriad-python. Installations of Miriad with source code
more recent than February 13, 2009 should work. (Version numbers
aren't very helpful in this case because Miriad release are almost
never made.) The particular error is a lack of the bugrecover_c 
function, which should be found in the libmir_uvio library. Consult
your local Miriad-installation guru for more help if you're not sure
how to react to this situation.
