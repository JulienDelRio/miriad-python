Miriad-Python 0.5.0
===================

Miriad-Python is a bridge between the MIRIAD radio analysis package and
the Python programming language. It allows you to:

* read and write MIRIAD datasets in Python,
* execute MIRIAD tasks from Python, and
* write MIRIAD tasks in Python.

For more information, see
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pkwill/miriad-python/ .  For helpful but
generic installation instructions, see the file INSTALL. For a few
more hints, see the website. For documentation, see the doc/
subdirectory; documentation files are processed using the program
Sphinx. If it's not available on your system, an up-to-date online
copy of the Miriad-Python documentation can be found on the
website. For changes from the previous release, see the file NEWS.

Miriad-Python is primarily written by Peter Williams,
pwilliams@astro.berkeley.edu . This is an early public release with
documentation that's somewhat preliminary, so feel free to get in touch
with him if you have any questions, particularly if you have trouble
installing or using Miriad-Python.


--with-miriad
=============

Miriad-Python needs to be linked with the MIRIAD shared library, and
hence you must tell the software where to find this library. This will
almost always be done with the --with-miriad=PATH argument to
the 'configure' script. Here, PATH is the *prefix* in which MIRIAD
has been installed. The following files should exist:

  PATH/include/miriad-c/miriad.h
  PATH/lib/libmir.so (the precise name of this may vary with OS)

This setup is only compatible with MIRIAD software built with the
"new-style" build system, which I (as the author of that build system)
fully endorse.

If you believe that you're specifying the correct --with-miriad
argument and the 'configure' checks are still failing, you can peruse
the file 'config.log', created by 'configure', for the particular error
that led the tool to fail. Sometimes unrelated problems can show up
in this phase of the configuration process. If you still have trouble,
consult your local system adminstrator (with complete contextual
information) or the Miriad-Python author.


bugrecover_c
============

(This section documents an error that may be reported by the 'configure'
script in certain conditions.)

First of all, sorry for the terse error message produced by the
'configure' program -- the tools we use make it really hard to produce
helpful, descriptive output at that point.

The source of this error is that your installation of Miriad is not
recent enough to contain certain hooks that are necessary for reliable
operation of miriad-python. Installations of Miriad with source code
more recent than February 13, 2009 should work. (Version numbers
aren't very helpful in this case because Miriad release are almost
never made.) The particular error is a lack of the bugrecover_c 
function, which should be found in the libmir library. Consult
your local Miriad-installation guru for more help if you're not sure
how to react to this situation.
