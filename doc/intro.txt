An Introduction to Miriad-Python
================================

*Miriad-Python* is a framework for interacting with the 
`MIRIAD <http://bima.astro.umd.edu/miriad/>`_ radio interferometry 
package via the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming 
language. It offers three main groups of features:

* Modules for :ref:`executing existing MIRIAD tasks <executing`.
* Libraries for :ref:`reading and using MIRIAD data files in Python <data>`.
* Libraries for :ref:`writing your own MIRIAD tasks in Python <pytasks>`.

And that's all of the introduction I can think of right now!
