An Introduction to Miriad-Python
================================

*Miriad-Python* is a framework for interacting with the 
`MIRIAD <http://bima.astro.umd.edu/miriad/>`_ radio interferometry 
package via the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming 
language. It offers three main groups of tools, used for:

* :ref:`reading and using MIRIAD data files in Python <data>`.
* :ref:`executing existing MIRIAD tasks <executing>`.
* :ref:`writing your own MIRIAD tasks in Python <pytasks>`.

You should get started by reading about :ref:`high-level access to
datasets <datahighlev>`.
