Loading and Processing MIRIAD Data
==================================

*Miriad-Python* deals with MIRIAD data on two levels:

* There is a lightweight high-level class, :class:`miriad.Data`, that
  allows you to easily store references to datasets, check whether they
  exist, rename them, and so on.

* There is a lower-level module, :mod:`mirtask`, that lets you open up 
  datasets and access at their contents directly. Doing so successfully
  requires a familiarity with the details of the MIRIAD data formats,
  which this documentation does not attempt to provide.

If you're just getting started with *Miriad-Python*, it's important to
understand the high-level :class:`miriad.Data` class but not necessary
to read about the low-level :mod:`mirtask` module just yet.
