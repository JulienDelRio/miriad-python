Loading and Processing MIRIAD Data
==================================

*Miriad-Python* deals with MIRIAD data on two levels:

* To refer to datasets abstractly, check whether they exist, rename them,
  *etc.*, there is the high-level :class:`miriad.Data` class.
* For opening up datasets and actually getting at their contents,
  you can use routines inside the :mod:`mirtask` module.

If you're just getting started with *Miriad-Python*, it's important to
understand the high-level :class:`miriad.Data` class but not necessary
to read about the low-level :mod:`mirtask` module just yet.
